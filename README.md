## **Challenges Faced**

*Explain how you overcame a particular obstacle or what could have been improved.*

## **What I Learned**

I first wondered about the purpose of making us implement functions that already exist in C. Wouldn't it be easier and more time-saving to just use the existing ones?

As I progressed through my curriculum at 42, I gradually figured out the point of this: simply knowing how to use functions doesn't make us good developers. Good developers know exactly how those functions work.

## **Reflections**

*If you've revisited any of your 42 projects to improve or refactor them, highlight this in the ReadMe.*
