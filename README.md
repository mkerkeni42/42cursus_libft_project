## **Challenges Faced**

As a beginner in coding, transitioning into programming was a thrilling challenge.  
Reimplementing standard library functions in C required me to tackle the complexities of pointers and memory management. ðŸ§   
Debugging my code often tested my patience, but overcoming these hurdles fueled my passion for coding and built my confidence as a developer. ðŸ’ª  

## **What I Learned**

I first wondered about the purpose of making us implement functions that already exist in C.  
Wouldn't it be easier and more time-saving to just use the existing ones? ðŸ¤”  
As I progressed through my curriculum at 42, I gradually figured out the point of this: simply knowing how to use functions doesn't make us good developers.  
Good developers know exactly how those functions work.ðŸ’¡âœ¨âœ¨
