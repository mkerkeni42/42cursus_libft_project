## **Challenges Faced**

*Explain how you overcame a particular obstacle or what could have been improved.*

## **What I Learned**

I first wondered about the purpose of making us implement functions that already exist in C. Wouldn't it be easier and more time-saving to just use the existing ones?

As I progressed through my curriculum at 42, I gradually figured out the point of this: simply knowing how to use functions doesn't make us good developers. Good developers know exactly how those functions work.

## **Reflections**

*Need to talk about how wise it was to making us start by learning C langage a low_level language*
*talk about how I added in my library other useful functions ever after validating the project*
*talk about how it is more practical to have those functions in order to modify them as we want*
